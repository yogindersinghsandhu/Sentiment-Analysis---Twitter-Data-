# Sentiment-Analysis---Twitter-Data-

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** of Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding customer opinions, public mood, and overall sentiment trends on social media platforms.

The project involves loading and cleaning Twitter data, applying machine learning models for sentiment classification, and evaluating the model's performance. Additionally, the project includes visualizations to better understand the data and results.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw Twitter text data for analysis.
- **Text Processing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Machine Learning**: Training a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, SVM) to classify tweets into sentiment categories.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and plots to analyze the distribution of sentiment and model performance.

## Project Structure

- **`Sentiment analysis twitter data.py`**: The main Python script that includes data preprocessing, text vectorization, sentiment classification, and model evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.
- **Dataset**: The dataset should be placed in the same directory as the script. It should contain Twitter data, ideally in CSV format, with columns such as "Tweet" and "Sentiment".

## Dependencies

To run the project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk` (for Natural Language Processing tasks)

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
